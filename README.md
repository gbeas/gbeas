## Oh hello

I'm Grace, and welcome to my youtube channel.

- I'm a public health analyst just preachin' the gospel of open-source to anyone who will listen.
- Things I'm currently working on:
  - Using R, quarto, and Shiny to building my own tools to track, analyze, and report wildlife and land management efforts in Aledo, Texas (yes I am aware that there are already tools I could use but where's the fun in that)
  - Making silly little apps and quarto websites for my own edification
  - Trying to :sparkles:finallyâœ¨ push some of my grad school projects to GitHub
- ðŸ“« Feel free to shoot me a message on LinkedIn (www.linkedin.com/in/grace-beasley)
